##### Angular example application built following the codeschool course

##### What I have learnt in this course was:

- There are directives in angular.js for eg: ng-controller
 https://github.com/heridev/Agular-js-example-app/commit/aa83e9eeac03ec02a2376fc6975bba4067d8b58f


- There are filters:

For example a filter that shows the currency and format a price:
```
<h2>{{ product.price | currency }}<h2>
``

They have the structure of:
```
{{ data | filter:options }}
``
